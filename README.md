# ConversionCalculator

The OCaml module provides a collection of functions for performing various unit conversions. It includes functions for converting lengths between meters and feet, temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit, weights/masses between kilograms and pounds, volumes between liters and gallons, energies between joules and calories, pressures between pascals and PSI, speeds between meters per second and miles per hour, cooking measurements between cups and tablespoons, data storage between bytes and kilobytes, and fuel consumption between miles per gallon and liters per 100 kilometers. These functions allow easy and accurate conversions between different units, making it convenient for beginner like me. 

I have solved few leetcode problems using OCaml. 

### How to compile and execute?
To compile and run each OCaml program, follow the same steps as before:
- Make sure OCaml and utop are installed on your system.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the .ml files.
- Compile the OCaml code using the ocamlc compiler:

``` bash
ocamlopt -o HitCounter HitCounter.ml
./HitCounter
```
```bash
ocamlopt -o ExpressionAddOperators ExpressionAddOperators.ml
./ExpressionAddOperators
```
```bash
ocamlopt -o WalkingRobotSimulation WalkingRobotSimulation.ml
./WalkingRobotSimulation
```
```bash
ocamlopt -o SnakeGame SnakeGame.ml
./SnakeGame
```
```bash
ocamlopt -o weightConvertor weightConvertor.ml
./weightConvertor
```
```bash
ocamlopt -o pressureConversion pressureConversion.ml
./pressureConversion
```
```bash
ocamlopt -o fuelConsumptionConverter fuelConsumptionConverter.ml
./fuelConsumptionConverter
```
```bash
ocamlopt -o dataStorageConverter dataStorageConverter.ml
./dataStorageConverter
```
```bash
ocamlopt -o currencyConverter currencyConverter.ml
./currencyConverter
```
```bash
ocamlopt -o fractionConverter fractionConverter.ml
./fractionConverter
```
```bash
ocamlopt -o timeConverter timeConverter.ml
./timeConverter
```
```bash
ocamlopt -o lengthConverter lengthConverter.ml
./lengthConverter
```
